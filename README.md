# ðŸš¦ Accident Detection System (Django + Machine Learning)

This is a *Django-based web application* for predicting and analyzing road accident positioning.  
It integrates *machine learning (SVM)* with a Django web dashboard to assist service providers in understanding accident trends and positioning.

---

## ðŸš€ Features
- Service provider login
- Upload and analyze *Datasets.csv*
- Train & test ML model (Support Vector Machine)
- View accuracy, classification report, and confusion matrix
- Ratio analysis: "In Position" vs "Not In Position"
- Data visualization with charts
- Export predictions to Excel (WIP)

---

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset
- Example dataset: [Kenya Road Accidents Database](https://data.humdata.org/dataset/kenya-road-accidents-database)  
- For this project, place the cleaned dataset as **Datasets.csv** in the project root.  
- Required columns:  
  - Fid â†’ Feature column (accident details text)  
  - Label â†’ Target column (0 = In Positioning, 1 = Not In Positioning)
